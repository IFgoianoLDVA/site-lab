abstract:  Soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura (Hemiptera - Aphididae), is a significant insect pest of soybean in North America. Accurate estimation of A. glycines densities requires costly, time-intensive weekly counts of adults and nymphs on plants. Field studies were conducted in 2013 and 2014 to assess the potential for spectral-based remote sensing to more efficiently quantify cumulative aphid-days (CADs) using soybean canopy reflectance.

summary: Near-infrared wavelengths at 780 ± 50 nm can effectively estimate A. glycines abundance on soybean. Our approach of simulating wide-band multispectral sensors from ground-based hyperspectral data helped to refine spectral sensors and holds potential to reduce the cost and complexity of treat/no-treat classification tasks. This study will contribute to future research aiming to quantify insect injury using customized commercial-grade sensors for detection, quantification, and differentiation of A. glycines from other
