abstract: Global consumption of oilseeds has been growing progressively over the last five growing seasons, with soybeans representing 60% of this sector. Therefore, to maintain high production in the Rio Verde region, State of Goiás, amidst phytopathological issues, this study aimed to identify the optimal spectral range for detecting H. glycines and P. brachyurus through linear regressions in soybeans at the R3 stage, as well as to develop mathematical models using multiple linear regressions. For this purpose, soil and root samples were collected in the experimental area, and a flight was conducted with the Sentera sensor. The data were utilized to construct regressions and to validate 2 mathematical models. Significant findings were observed in the simple linear regression exclusively for cysts in the visible spectrum, demonstrating a strong R² value for the Green, Red, and 568 nm bands for non-viable cysts. Employing stepwise statistics yielded improved results for H. glycines, now with an adjusted R² of 0.7430, and subsequently detecting P. brachyurus. From the mathematical model derived through multiple linear regression for non-viable cysts with an adjusted R² of 0.7430, it is feasible to ascertain the spatial distribution of nematodes across the soybean field, enabling targeted management to optimize treatments. The mathematical model developed via simple linear regression also shows promising outcomes.

summary: Our study targeted the detection of H. glycines and P. brachyurus in soybeans, crucial for managing phytopathological issues in the Rio Verde, Goiás. Utilizing soil and root samples, and aerial data from the Sentera sensor, we applied linear regressions and developed mathematical models to pinpoint effective spectral ranges for pest detection. The optimal spectral range for H. glycines was 586 nm, showing a promising R² of 0.649 for detecting non-viable cysts. Although initial attempts found no significant results for P. brachyurus through simple linear regression, the integration of Green and Nir-NDVI bands in a mathematical model significantly improved detection. For H. glycines, combining Red, Green, and 825 nm bands enhanced the model's accuracy, with an adjusted R² of 0.7430. These advancements allow for precise mapping of nematode infestations, facilitating targeted pest management and optimizing treatment applications, showcasing the potential of multiple linear regression in agricultural pest detection.
